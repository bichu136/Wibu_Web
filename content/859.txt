<p itemprop="description">Upon meeting for the first time, undefeated street fighter Marcus Damon and renegade Digimon Agumon become friends in the most natural way possible for the knuckleheaded duoâ€”by fighting their hearts out. The self-proclaimed "ultimate team" are recruited by a secret government organization called the Digimon Data Squad, or DATS, who had witnessed an unbelievable human fighting blow for blow with a Digimon. Their primary objective is investigating mysterious problems caused by Digimon entering the real world, and the world is currently in the midst of a crisis with Digimon appearing at an unprecedented rate. <br>
<br>
Embarking on various missions with DATS, Marcus and Agumon become colleagues with adolescent genius Thomas H. Norstein and his Digimon partner Gaoman, along with the kind-hearted Yoshino "Yoshi" Fujeda and her Digimon partner Lalamon. As the group continues to investigate the rapid increase of Digimon in their world, a darker truth begins to surface, and it is up to Marcus, Agumon, and their friends to get to the bottom of things.<br>
