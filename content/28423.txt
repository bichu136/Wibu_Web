<p itemprop="description">A very strange thing happened to Mamiya Sakura as a child: She disappeared in the woods behind her grandmother's house. Of course, Sakura doesn't quite recall what happened next, but she's been seeing dead people ever sinceâ€”ghosts at home, ghosts at school, and even ghosts on the street.<br>
<br>
Now that she's in high school, another strange thing has happened in her life. A desk next to her that's sat empty all year is suddenly filled by an oddly-dressed boy named Rokudou Rinne. Rinne seems to be capable of seeing the same things Sakura does, and sometimes, other people can't even see <i>him</i>. What sort of secret is Rinne-kun hiding, and how is he connected to Sakura's strange power? In <i>Kyoukai no Rinne</i>, another world exists alongside the one we live in. Thanks to Rinne, Mamiya Sakura will get to know this world and the wacky characters that inhabit it.</p>
