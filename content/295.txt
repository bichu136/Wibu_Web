<p itemprop="description">Through the long distance warp called the "Exodus Project", Worns, Ryer and the<br>
other crew members of "Watchers Nest" manage to escape from the Earth. Misaki, who<br>
was attending the final battle with "Ghoul" at that time, isn't present there and<br>
before her eyes, the earth changes and gets enclosed by a time barrier.<br>
<br>
Ryer and the others search for a way to escape from this space time maze, but the<br>
earth changes to various forms. Innumerable "Nows" appear due to varying time axes. <br>
<br>
And also Misaki, who should have disappeared because of the Exodus Project incident,<br>
still afortiori. Before Ryer and the others, different forms of Misaki appear. The<br>
Misaki from training school, the Misaki from her childhood days.<br>
<br>
Are these reflections caused by the conflicts that exist inside Misaki?<br>
<br>
She awakens a second time and when she derives the response, that history is leading<br>
into a completely differnet direction now.<br>
<br>
Will Misaki, Ryer and the others be able to find a real happy end?!<br>
