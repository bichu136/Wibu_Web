<p itemprop="description">Fifteen-year-old Kyousuke Kasuga moves to a new city and becomes enamored by one Madoka Ayukawa, who often treats him coldly even though she seemed friendly the first time they met, when he caught her red straw hat on the stairs. Kyousuke also must try to avoid breaking the heart of the slightly childish Hikaru Hiyama, who fell in love with him after she saw him make an impossible shot with a basketball and who likes to shower him with affection. Also, just to make things interesting, Kyousuke, his sisters, his grandfather, and his cousins all have various powers (teleportation, psychokinesis, hypnosis, time travel, personality transference) which Kyousuke desperately tries to keep a secret, though some of the other family members have no such qualms against using their powers in public.<br>
