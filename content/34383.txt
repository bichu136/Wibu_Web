<p itemprop="description">High school students Yuma Okazaki and Hotaru Mizushina are childhood friends. With their respective boyfriends, Takeda and Fujiwara, their lives couldn't be more perfect. From playing in school to going on group dates, it seems nothing can break their bond. <br>

Taken aback by this peculiar action, Yuma awkwardly retreats to the toilets, followed shortly by her aggressor.
