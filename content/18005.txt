<p itemprop="description">A soccer anime with a cast of wacky animals in sports getup seems far out of its time in the early 21st century, but it was the year of the World Cup in Japan and South Korea, and the very young audience sees these tropes with fresh eyes. Hidemaru is a feisty fox; his friends include bunnies, dogs, horses, and a couple of hefty hippo girls. <br>
<br>
Based on a manga <em>Hidemaru the Soccer Boy</em> by Makoto Mizobuchi, serialized in CoroCoro Comics. <br>
