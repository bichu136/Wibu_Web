<p itemprop="description">Despite being talented in various sports, Shunichi Domoto is not passionate about any of them in particularâ€”that is, until he discovers the world of competitive yo-yo.<br>

It all begins when Shunichi's friend, Beso Kimura, loses his yo-yo in a duel against the school bully, Benkei Musashimaru.

However, after losing to the exceptionally gifted yo-yo player Seito Hojoin, Shinichi finds his ego shattered. As the humiliating loss ignites a spark in Shunichi, he decides to surpass Seito in Japan's national Yo-yo Championship!<br>
