<p itemprop="description">Super Sonico is a clutzy, adorable, and well-endowed 18-year old girl. She's a complete sucker for anything cute, especially stray cats, all of which she giddily adopts. However, though Sonico should be enjoying a carefree and simple lifestyle as a young college student, her life is really anything but easy: she must balance being a professional model, working part-time at her grandmother's restaurant, and practicing guitar and performing concerts with her friends Suzu Fujimi and Fuuri Watanuki in their band, First Astronomical Velocityâ€”all while attending college. <i>SoniAni: Super Sonico the Animation</i> follows Sonico as she faces daunting challenges in her search for her place in the world, even when her days are brimming with love and happiness.<br>
