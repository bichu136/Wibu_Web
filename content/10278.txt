<p itemprop="description">765 Production Studio manages the unique talents of 13 professional idols as they slowly make their way to the top and become country-wide celebrities.

As the girls' fame grows, however, their time together as a family diminishes, and now the very popularity they sought is threatening to tear them apart. A difficult balance of work and bonding must be achieved, or they risk everyone going their separate ways. The personal and professional ordeals of these idols can't be conquered alone, but with each other's loving support, any obstacle or hardship can be overcome!<br>
