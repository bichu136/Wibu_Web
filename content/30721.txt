A severe drop in quality leads to the production of three substandard Hacka Dolls. Due to their personality defects, they are sent to Earth, tasked with advancing humanity in whatever way they can.

Despite their shortcomings, they take their mission very seriously and always try their best to assist everyone with incredible enthusiasm.<br>
