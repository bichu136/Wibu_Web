<p itemprop="description">A young boy silently sketches out the forms of the horrors that dwell in his mind. During this adventure into the occult and mysterious, he tells tales that involve dreams of a person with a muscular arm that you must not look at, a hospital with a room that holds a grim secret, and a visit to an eerily silent taxidermy museum.<br>
<br>
These tales and more are compiled in <i>Yami Shibai 3</i>. Presented in an art style similar to kamishibai storytelling, this horror series stays true to the gruesome and creepy trend that is prominent in <i>Yami Shibai</i> and <i>Yami Shibai 2nd Season</i>.<br>
