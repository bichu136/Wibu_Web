The story begins with Aichi Sendou, a timid middle schooler whose meek attitude often leaves him a target for bullies. Aichi was given a very rare card, "Blaster Blade", when he was very young. It's his one treasure that gives him hope. That is, until it gets taken from him. Although Aichi has never played Cardfight!!

This high-stakes game quickly draws Aichi into the world of Vanguard battles, which will test and change his worth as both a player and a person. </p>
