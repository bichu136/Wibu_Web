<p itemprop="description">With the invention of anti-gravitational shoes known as Grav-Shoes, the ability to fly freely has become an everyday experience for the people inhabiting a four-island archipelago south of Japan. This invention has brought the people new ways of living and also a new sport known as "Flying Circus," where participants gain points by either touching floating buoys or their opponent's back.<br>

Led by their coach, Masaya Hinata, their members consist of the experienced Misaki Tobisawa and her overprotective friend, Mashiro Arisaka. <i>Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm</i> follows this rookie group soaring high above the skies and toward their dreams, armed only with their unwavering passion against an uncertain future.<br>
